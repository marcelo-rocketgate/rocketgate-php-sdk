Rocketgate Gateway PHP SDK
===========

This library is __compatible__ with PHP 5.6, although we highly recommend
to migrate your project to PHP 7.2 or greater, to avoid security breaches 
(refer to PHP Supported Versions [here](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php)).

## Installation using composer

Install with composer (available on packagist.org):

```sh
composer require --update-no-dev rocketgate/sdk
```

## Installation without composer

Create a vendor folder (or use your project's external dependencies folder):
```sh
mkdir -p vendor/rocketgate
```

Clone into that folder
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rocketgate/rocketgate-php-sdk.git vendor/rocketgate
```

Add classes to your project autoloader or manually (as shown below). 
```php
<?php

require "vendor/rocketgate/src/GatewayChecksum.php";
require "vendor/rocketgate/src/GatewayCodes.php";
require "vendor/rocketgate/src/GatewayParameterList.php";
require "vendor/rocketgate/src/GatewayRequest.php";
require "vendor/rocketgate/src/GatewayResponse.php";
require "vendor/rocketgate/src/GatewayService.php";

use RocketGate\Sdk\GatewayRequest;
use RocketGate\Sdk\GatewayResponse;
use RocketGate\Sdk\GatewayService;

$request  = new GatewayRequest();
$response = new GatewayResponse();
$service  = new GatewayService();

$request->Set(GatewayRequest::MERCHANT_ID(), "1");
$request->Set(GatewayRequest::MERCHANT_PASSWORD(), "testpassword");

// [...]
```

## Usage

Integration examples with Rocketgate Gateway are placed under `/tests` folder.  

## Run full test suite (without RG docker container)

```sh
$ sh vendor/rocketgate/sdk/startup.sh
```

## Run full test suite (with RG docker container)

We recommend using both [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and 
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) in order to run full test suite.

1. Start docker container.
 
```shell script
$ docker-compose up -d
```
The command above might take longer at first execution because all PHP Docker container 
dependencies will be downloaded and installed.

2. Run `startup.sh` script.
```shell script
docker exec -it $(docker-compose ps -q --filter name=cli_php) bash startup.sh
```

## Important notes
- To run tests PHP >=7.0 is required.
- Startup script `startup.sh` installs composer PHP dependencies and run complete test suite.
- Output should look like this:
  ```
  Do not run Composer as root/super user! See https://getcomposer.org/root for details
  Loading composer repositories with package information
  Installing dependencies (including require-dev) from lock file
  Nothing to install or update

- Successful test represent a dot (".").
- Failed test prints Rocketgate request data along with "F" character. Example:
```

- Any non-compliant Rocketgate modification made on source code SDK will make `::testComplianceModifications` 
fail, as shown below:
```
1) RocketGate\Sdk\Tests\GatewayChecksumTest::testComplianceModifications
